# Machine Learning Project Repository

Welcome to our Machine Learning Project Repository! This collection of projects is designed to explore various fundamental concepts and algorithms in machine learning, ranging from statistical methods to deep learning techniques. Each project is contained within its own folder, focusing on a specific topic, and provides hands-on examples to demonstrate the theory and application of the algorithms discussed.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the projects, make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed on your machine. These may include, but are not limited to:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch

Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file in each project folder for specific dependencies and versions.

## Projects Overview

### Lecture 1: MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) and Naive Bayes Classification
- **Folder**: `lec_1`
- **Description**: This project introduces the concept of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and its application in statistical inference. It also covers the Naive Bayes Classification technique, a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

### Lecture 2: Logistic Regression and Cross Validation
- **Folder**: `lec_2`
- **Description**: Explore the logistic regression model, a fundamental algorithm for binary classification problems. This project also delves into cross-validation techniques to evaluate the model's performance and ensure its generalizability.

### Lecture 3: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - ReLU layer, Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss
- **Folder**: `lec_3`
- **Description**: Dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a cornerstone of deep learning for image and video recognition. Focus on the ReLU activation function and the concept of Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss for training CNNs.

### Lecture 4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Folder**: `lec_4`
- **Description**: This project covers Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization, alongside the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet effective method for classification and regression.

### Lecture 5: Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Folder**: `lec_5`
- **Description**: Learn about the Decision Tree algorithm for classification and regression problems. This project also revisits the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, reinforcing its concepts and applications.
